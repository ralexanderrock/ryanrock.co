Projects I am developing in my free time are [Ephemera]('Ephemera'){:href='http://www.ephemera.net/' target="_blank"}, [Terraformarium]('Terraformarium'){:href='http://www.terraformarium.com/' target="_blank"},  and [Juicebox]('Juicebox'){:href="http://www.juicebox.club/" target="_blank"}. More information on these projects is below. As always, if you are interested in getting involved in these projects please give me a shout.

### [Ephemera]('Ephemera'){:href="http://www.ephemera.net" target="_blank"}

This is an tokenized proxy network. Ephemera is a fully decentralized proxy network similar to TOR, but with all intermediaries paid by the user. Several problems must be overcome in order to accomplish this goal without weakening the anonymity that onion routing networks provide. Generally speaking, this is overcome by using anonymized micropayment channels. Coding for this project is currently underway. I anticipate providing a functional pre-release version Summer 2019.

*Note: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ephemeranetwork), Discord, Github, and PyPi accounts have been set up. However, these will not be actively monitored until the initial code release later this year.*

### [Terraformarium]('Terraformarium'){:href="http://www.terraformarium.com" target="_blank"}

The Terraformarium is an ultra-cold vacuum chamber designed to simulate surface conditions on Mars. This is intended on as a hobby exercise. I will be personally using this Martian terrarium to culture lichens with the hope that some may be able to grow even under extremely adverse conditions. I hope that the project inspires others to think seriously about new terraforming technologies, the potential for martian habitability, and engenders greater enthusiasm for astrobiological research. Updates on this project will be available through the website.

### [Juicebox]('Juicebox'){:href="http://www.juicebox.club/" target="_blank"}

Juicebox is a service where subscribers are mailed boxes of E-juice matched to their flavor preferences using algorithmic recommender systems. This project is not currently under active development. I will provide additional details as they become available.
