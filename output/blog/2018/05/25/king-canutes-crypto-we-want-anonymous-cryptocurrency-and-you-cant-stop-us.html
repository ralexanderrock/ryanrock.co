    <p><img alt="Can't touch this!" src="/images/you-cant-touch-this.jpg"></p>
<p>There's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Canute_and_the_tide">ancient legend</a> about a king named Canute that I drone on about to pretty much anyone who listens. I'll retell it here because the story's wisdom applies directly to the crypto-war already frothing between developers and their governments - the fight over truly private and anonymous currency.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>Canute had sat beside the sea and then, in front of his people, he commanded the tides not to rise. Sure as you'd expect the tides rose and wetted his throne. After which he exclaimed to his entourage "Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings..." Not even kings can command the sea. The historicity of the story is surely a matter of debate, but that doesn't undermine the important philosophical truth to be found here: natural law supercedes all the laws of man. Period. Full stop.</p>
<p>You cannot close your eyes and make gravity repel, you can't will the speed of light to change, and you can't make particles abandon quantum uncertainty. The universe already decided how it's going to work whether you like that or not. You're no doubt wondering what any of this has to do with cryptography or privacy. Just remember that politicans, bankers, monarchs, and tyrants all live in the same world that King Canute did. The existence of difficult math problems is what underpins modern cryptography. I don't care how much money or power you have, you can't escape math. This universe respects privacy even when powerful people don't want to. It just happens to be the case that if you have the ability to speak privately and anonymously you can also exchange money secretly.<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> After all, what is a transaction but a message shared between a buyer, a seller, and a public record so that everyone else knows you're not cheating? </p>
<h2>Four Horsemen of the Infopocalypse</h2>
<p>Whenever revolutionary change happens existing power structures see that change as an existential threat.<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> It comes as no shock that institutions fight tooth and nail to protect their interests. We've seen governments act this out before. By now you know the drill, it starts out like "encryption will let [insert villain here] do [name bad thing here] and we won't be able to stop them." Don't take my word for it though - here's Diane Feinstein, former chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that Silicon Valley has to take a look at their products. Because if you create a product that allows evil monsters to communicate in this way, to behead children, to strike innocents, whether it's at a game in a stadium, in a small restaurant in Paris, take down an airliner. That's a big problem. So we need high tech's help in securing an Internet that even with a court order, you can't get to what they are saying. That is a big problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sentiment here is pervasive, and most people buy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse">four horsemen of the infopocalypse</a> stuff hook, line, and sinker. It's not just Feinstein either, there is an abundance of juicy quotes like this speckled around the web. I can't stress enough that banning these technologies doesn't solve the four horsemen problem, and allowing them doesn't prevent the problem from being solved either.</rant></p>
<p>When encryption technology was first coming into popular use, governments around the world began classifying encryption technologies as armaments. They used this same tired whine of "but what if the bad guys use it?" If they had gotten their way in the U.S. travelling with a phone that had Signal installed or was capable of full disk encryption would probably get you thrown in jail. Yes, literally, bringing a modern cell phone on vacation to Tahiti would have been akin to smuggling an assault rifle under those laws. </p>
<p><img alt="I prefer it my way." src="/images/prefer-it-my-way.gif"></p>
<p>The laws have since relaxed and exceptions have been made for encryption software that isn't "military grade" and is for personal use. Nowadays, we greet this history with a yawn because encryption is everything but ubiquitous. Mostly because a few smart folks pushed the envelope and illegally used it anyway - and in the process wrote the software that today <em>does</em> secure the internet. Since then we haven't gotten the infopocalypse that all those naysayers harped on about.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is just the latest bogeyman. It'll be an even steeper battle this time around too. Before the fight was just with law enforcement. This time around the fight will be against the most powerful institutions on the planet - the global banking community and entire nation-states. They won't be happy that you don't need middlemen to do your banking or that the tax man has no clue what assets you own. You'd be a fool to think they're not going to come out swinging - hard. </p>
<p><img alt="Come on, hit me!" src="/images/hit-me.gif"></p>
<h2>Turn that frown upside down.</h2>
<p>The real problem here is that power institutions are focusing on the wrong thing. They should be focused on how to innovate and adapt to a freer and more decentralized future. After all, banks can still manage capital and act as finance institutions and governments can still do police work here in fleshspace. None of that really changes, it just makes their lives harder and they don't like it.</p>
<p>Sadly, they'll still pass laws banning fully anonymous and private cryptocurrency. We're already seeing the first volleys in this war:</p>

</ul>
<p>In the end we'll just have to keep building software and make it go mainstream anyway. </p>
<p>A favorite piece of philosophy of mine is from Hobbes. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/">Sharon Lloyd and Susanne Sreedhar</a> summarize it best: "legislation without interpretation and enforcement will not serve to regulate conduct." Our challenge is to make all laws restricting anonymous and private exchange completely unenforceable.</p>
<p>Luckily the universe is on our side - it likes chaos. It's easier to scramble things than unscramble them. Math and physics just work that way. The computational difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem and other similar mathematical formulations appear unavoidable. Simply put, there are math problems that are much harder to get the answer for but much easier to confirm that an answer is correct. That asymmetry is what lets us mathemtically hide our passwords, our text messages and emails, and now even our transactions. So long as the math doesn't change we can engineer complete privacy and anonymity.</p>

<li id="fn-1">
<p>There's a reason why I keep saying privacy and anonymity. The two are not the same thing. Privacy means that information is confidential between all the intended participants. It says nothing about whether outsiders know who is participating in the conversation. Anonymity is privacy's complement. To be anonymous means that no matter what you say, public or private, no one know it's you who's saying it. You need both to truly communicate freely.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>The biggest innovation in cryptocurrency is that all you need is a message to exchange money. The core problem is that cryptologic methods like one-way hashing functions, public key encryption, and zero-knowledge proofs enable both privacy and anonymity. If you have privacy, anonymity, and your banking system amounts to communication between counterparties and a public ledger then your whole system is symmetric to a money laundry. That's what this whole debate is about.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
