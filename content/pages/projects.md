Projects I am developing in my free time are [Ephemera]('Ephemera'){:href='http://www.ephemera.net/' target="_blank"} and [Juicebox]('Juicebox'){:href="http://www.juicebox.club/" target="_blank"}. More information can be found on these projects below. As always if you are interested in getting involved in these projects please give me a shout.

### [Ephemera]('Ephemera'){:href="http://www.ephemera.net" target="_blank"}

This is an incentivized proxy network. The idea is to have a fully decentralized proxy network similar to TOR, but with all intermediaries paid by the user. Several problems must be overcome in order to accomplish this goal without weakening the anonymity that onion routing networks provide. Generally speaking, this is overcome by using anonymized micropayment channels enabled by zero-knowledge proofs. Coding for this project is underway and I anticipate releasing a pre-launch version of the codebase sometime near the end of 2018. 


### [Juicebox]('Juicebox'){:href="http://www.juicebox.club/" target="_blank"}

Juicebox is a service where subscribers are mailed boxes of E-juice matched to their flavor preferences using algorithmic recommender systems. This project is still in the idea phase. Naturally, I have yet to work out most of the details. More is yet to come, and I'll be sure to provide updates in the future. Time permitting, I expect to launch this service sometime next year.
