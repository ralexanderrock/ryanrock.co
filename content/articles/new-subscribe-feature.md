The Terraformarium site is now live! One of the features that I desparately wanted to include while getting that site up and running was a free and easy subscription form that was static and didn't require paying a third-party. The solution that I chose was to embed an html form, have the form data submitted to a google script which adds the form data to a google sheet, and have that data sent wherever using Zapier. This method has some serious advantages in that it costs me literally nothing and I can receive email notifications and automated subscriptions to my newsletters without any of the branded content from mailchimp.

I highly recommend this method for other static site operators that are budget constrained or want to get this functionality quick and dirty. Also, feel free to view the source and duplicate as needed. If anyone needs links to the google scripts, just give me a shout.

Make sure you subscribe, and cheers!
