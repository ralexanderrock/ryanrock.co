The Terraformarium site is now live! One of the features that I desparately wanted to include while getting that site up and running was a free and easy subscription form that did not require me to switch to dynamic webpages (and all of the headaches that are associated with that) or pay a third-party. The solution that I chose was to embed a Google form which takes basic contact information and then have that data ported over to mailchimp using Zapier. It's quick and easy and I highly recommend it for other static site owners that don't require a highly refined end product.

I've omitted the steps to complete such a feature, but if you're interested shoot me an email and I can whip up a new post. And make sure to subscribe!
