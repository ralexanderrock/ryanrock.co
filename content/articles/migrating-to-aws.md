Just a quick update for those of you who may have noticed some changes to the blog. First off, I just added a quoteblog to the site. Feel free to check it out at [quoteblog](http://ryanrock.co/pages/quoteblog.html). More importantly I finally took the initiative to get away from Godaddy's not-so-great hosting and migrated the blog to an Amazon EC2 instance.

It's been fun challenging myself to use EC2 for the first time, and finally getting a good opportunity to stretch some seriously atrophied server skills. It also made sense to set up a newsletter to let readers get notified about new blogs posts. For the listserv I installed postfix and integrated it with GNU Mailman on EC2.  I'll finish building out the mailserver in the days/weeks to come as time allows. As you know I love teaching myself new skills. So teaching myself how to configure this has been deeply rewarding even if it is pretty basic stuff that's straightforward to a lot of people.

Auf Wiedersehen!
