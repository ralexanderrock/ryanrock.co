Some of you have been curious about the state of my work products. True to form, my timelines for Ephemera and Verichain (not yet announced) were too ambitious and have slipped. I'll provide more specific updates in future blog posts, and provide a more thorough rundown on what Verichain is and when some work product can be expected.

Others among you have been wondering why I've been more MIA than usual. There's simply no time to commute/go out when so much of that is committed to remaining physically healthy and being productive. My major goal for this year was to refocus my time spent towards my projects as well as increase my total number of hours worked. So far this year I've averaged 97.6 hours per week, and this month I've averaged approx. 106 hours per week. This is why I've essentially become a social ghost.

I'm now working at my day job part time with the remainder of my working time split about 80:20 between Ephemera and Verichain. I suspect that will remain the case until after Ephemera's pre-release at which point I'll reassess how my time is being allocated.

If you have any questions, just give me shout. Y'all know how to find me.

Cheers!
