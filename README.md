This is the public repository for my personal website. I hope you enjoy this work and that it helps you set up your own site. Cheers!

## About the blog

I've had the idea to set up this site for a long time. Keep in mind it's mostly just ramblings that would float around my head or be otherwise blurted at strangers in inopportune settings if it weren't being shouted into the internet void. Not all of my writing is meant to be taken seriously - some is.
