So after many months of hemming and hawing I finally buckled down and set up my personal page. It's been rough lately motivating myself to do things that feel so low on my priority list. Alas, I've been moving in with my partner of 4+ years while splitting my time between work and building Ephemera. Contradictory as it is, putting this site together has been a nice little respite from the doldrums of my daily grind.

For the curious among you, I stumbled on this nifty tool [pelican](http://getpelican.com/) while browsing around github. Admittedly I was looking for good ways to automate the documentation pages for Ephemera, and got a little...sidetracked. Anyways, pelican allows you to draft articles in your markup language of choice (Markdown in my case) and it translates the content into nice and neat html pages. The theme I've chosen, for now, is [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/flex). I stumbled onto it while browsing [xomg's blog](https://blog.xomg.net/) - still not sure how I managed to end up there. Alice, if you ever read this, kudos on the sierpinski gasket animation using the chaos game algorithm. I'd only discovered that myself a few days ago on Numberphile. But I digress, it's a super easy way to quickly make blogs and certainly triumphs over WordPress for ease of customization.

Stay tuned, there will be much more to come!
