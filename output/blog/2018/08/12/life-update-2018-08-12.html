    <p>It's clearly been a while since my last post. A lot has happened since. As many of you know I get some wacky ideas pretty regularly, and the time since my last post has been no exception. I've also just returned from a life-changing camping trip in Colorado. </p>
<h1>Terraformarium</h1>
<p>For one, a few weeks ago I started thinking pretty seriously about terraforming Mars and found a new obsession - lichens. One thought lead to another and I came up with a new project to work on which I'm calling Terraformarium.</p>
<p>My partner and I had been tossing the idea of making a self-sustaining biosphere inside of a glass jar for almost a year, but never really got around to doing it. True to form, I decided I could do it better as a terraforming experiment. Why try to make a terrarium that simulates an Earth ecosystem when you could make one that simulates Mars and is a proof of concept for lichen terraforming? I'm not aware of anyone else having tried this as a hobbyist, and it's always fun to be the first at something. </p>
<p>In the last few years there have been a number of experiments done by researchers at NASA, ESA, and other research organizations that try to do precisely this. For instance, lichen specimens have been taken to the International Space Station and left exposed or partially exposed to space conditions. The lichens were returned to Earth and were shown to remain biologically active. These experiments characterize the survivability of particular lichen species, but none that I'm aware of attempt to show whether an entire ecosystem of lichens can survive Martian conditions. While the terraformarium won't be part of a rigorous scientific study, it will be of interest to see just how hardy these organisms are, and to see if the presence of other species influences their growth in any way.</p>
<p>The concept behind the terraformarium is simple: create a vacuum chamber which simulates (as close as possible) the temperatures, pressure, atmospheric composition, and radiation found on the Martian surface inside of which I will attempt to grow lichens on Mars regolith simulant. The major constraints are that the device must be must be aesthetically pleasing (like any other terrarium) and that the cost should be reasonable. The last three weeks have involved reading scientific literature about Mars, learning about cascade refrigeration design principles, finding cost effective components, getting EPA certified under the clean air act to buy the refrigerants, and generally planning out all major design aspects (e.g. LED light panel, power supply, specimen transfer system, etc.)</p>
<h1>Lichens</h1>
<p>In order to do the Terraformarium I also need to begin specimen collection. I've gone on some collection walks in the western suburbs of Chicago. Most of my samples have been successfully transplanted onto new substrates and within just two weeks are exhibiting signs of healthy growth in my apartment. I'm also growing some samples under a pure CO2 atmosphere just to see what happens. Among the specimens, some vivid blue-black physcia aipolia is growing the best. The others are doing alright, but in all honesty I'm still uncertain what their particular taxonomic classifications are. </p>
<p>The pursuit of diverse lichen specimens is a fun addition to my camping goals. In years past it has mostly just been to hike and to perhaps stargaze, but now I've given myself a good reason to get out into the wilderness and see what I can find. The timing also worked perfectly with the Colorado trip I describe below. This trip has produced some great cladonia, rhizocarpon, and other specimens. I'll include these photos in the Colorado album and on the forthcoming Terraformarium webpage. The rhizocarpon in particular looks stunning under black light and you'll want to see those pictures for certain. </p>
<h1>Colorado</h1>
<p>Two years in the making, my partner and I finally returned from a camping trip in Estes Park. We had been planning to do a Colorado camping trip but never seemed to find the right time to pack up and go. We left last Tuesday after two months of planning. This trip quickly became by far the best camping trip I've been on. The landscapes were astounding, the hiking was strenuous, the wildlife was majestic, and the stargazing was the best in my life.</p>
<p>On the first full day at camp we hiked up to Timber Lake, Rocky Mountain National Park at about 11,000 ft. Exerting ourselves for several miles and a net elevation change of 2000 ft. this was the most challenging hike we've been on. Living in Chicago we are not adapted for these altitudes and altitude sickness set in quickly. The entire hike, while fantastic, was accompanied by an acute headache. Once we reached camp, I quickly fell ill. It became very difficult to form cohesive thoughts, my headache crescendoed, and I become more nauseous than any of my worst hangovers. I ended up falling asleep at 8pm, early enough to worry my partner to the point of almost calling park rangers for medical help. I woke up perfectly fine, just very hungry having missed the prior dinner and annoyed that the hike had cost me an entire night of stargazing.</p>
<p>The Perseid meteor shower is still going on as I type this, but we managed to catch the first days of the shower while camping out in Timber Lake. The isolation of this particular spot provided the darkest night sky I've seen in almost a decade, and the moon was nowhere in sight. The Perseids were raining down at about one meteor every ten minutes or so, no doubt there where countless others that I missed or couldn't been seen. </p>
<p>One meteor in particular is burned into my memory, and probably will be for the rest of my life. It entered the atmosphere with a thin blue streak, streaked directly overhead turning a bright white-yellow. Instead of passing through the atmosphere or fizzling out, this meteor exploded. The tail grew more and more fuzzy as it passed further South and finally disappeared in a yellow-orange fireball that went off much like a sparkler on the fourth of July. It was spectacular in a way that I can't capture in words.</p>
<p>I also had set up an AstroMaster 130 to do some basic astronomy. Nothing fancy, but I did manage to get some great views of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. I was able to see some surface features on Mars and was also able to see a handful of Jovian moons which appeared as small points of light. I'll definitely be investing in a better telescope and want to take my amateur astronomy more seriously.</p>
<p>Each night some small animals and elk wandered into camp looking for food. Our last night in camp was particularly terrifying though. The tent was whipping around with winds more significant than any of the previous nights, which in turn gave the fauna cover to move without being heard. Around 2am elk were sniffing around the tent, but I quickly went to sleep knowing that they meant little harm. Between 3-4am I woke very startled hearing the characteristic low grumble of a bear. I quickly realized I was foolish enough to bring some peanuts into the tent earlier and they certainly didn't go unnoticed by our furry friend. It took around a half hour the bear to finally leave our vicinity, but that was by far the most face-palming, heart attack inducing thirty minutes I've experienced.</p>
<p>All-in-all this was by far the most impactful vacation I've ever been on. Pushing your body to it's physical limit, realizing your place in the cosmos, and being inches away from an animal that could kill you with a thought all within three days puts just about everything into perspective. The volume on life is certainly turned down now.</p>
<p>For those of you who are interested I'll be finally adding an album tool to this blog. I had mentioned to some of you that I would put up the Amsterdam/Berlin New Year's Eve and Hawaii vacation photos but have procrastinated on this. I'll be sure to get everything up including the Colorado photos in the next week or so. Keep an eye out for a new blog post if you want a gander. </p>
