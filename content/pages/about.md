I am a chemical engineering graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago. I work as an international trade analyst at Rock Trade Law LLC and assist with the day to day operations of the law firm. However, I look forward to continuing my pursuit of an academic career and hope to research the intersection of industrial process controls and cybersecurity.

I consider myself a multi-disciplinarian and autodidact. My hobbies include developing new programming skills, tinkering with electronics, camping, cooking, and discovering new films. Favorite topics of conversation include longevity, artifical intelligence, and automation. Feel free to email or find me on social media if you have any questions or just want to chat.
