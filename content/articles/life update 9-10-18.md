Summary: So we found a turtle this weekend...


#Turtle Dad
My partner's father stumbled across a small turtle crossing the road in the western suburbs this weekend. We aren't entirely sure what species the little fella is, but we're fairly confident that its a male common snapping turtle.

We just didn't feel right leaving the little guy outside to struggle as he seemed awfully lethargic and ill-prepared for the cold snap we've been encountering here in Illinois. Instead, we chose to bring him in and help him grow up to have a fighting chance. Since he's likely to get very aggressive it's not possible to keep him long term, and if we wait too long releasing him to the wild would mean certain death. We're going to get him set up in a medium sized terrarium and provide mostly live food, then once he outgrows his enclosure he'll be off to the races.

Pictures are already up on instagram, and more will be sure to come as this little guy grows up.
