    <p>For years I've compiled index cards of quotes that have made an impression on me. At first I kept them on the back of my bedroom door so that they were the first thing I saw when I woke up in the morning. A few month's ago I stumbled onto Aaron Schwartz's quoteblog <a href="http://qblog.aaronsw.com/" target="_blank" title="Raw Meat">Raw Meat</a>. Almost a decade after making the first card, I've decided to open source my quote collection. I hope they inspire you just as they have inspired me. Cheers!</p>
